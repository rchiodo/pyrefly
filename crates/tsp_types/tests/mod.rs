//! Tests for TSP types - parameter construction, serialization, and type validation
//!
//! This module contains tests that focus purely on tsp_types functionality:
//! - Parameter type construction and validation
//! - Serialization/deserialization round-trips
//! - Flag and enum validation
//! - Type structure validation
//!
//! These tests are separate from integration tests that require the main pyrefly crate.
