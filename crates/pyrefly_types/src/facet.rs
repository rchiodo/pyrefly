/// The idea of "facet narrowing" is that for attribute narrowing, index narrowing,
/// and some other cases we maintain a tree of "facets" (things like attributes, etc)
/// for which we have narrowed types and we'll use these both for narrowing and for
/// reading along "facet chains".
///
/// For example if I write
/// `if x.y is not None and x.z is not None and x.y[0]["w"] is not None: ...`
/// then we'll wind up with two facet chains narrowed in our tree, one at
///   [Attribute(y), Index(0), Key("w")]
/// and another at
///   [Attribute(z)]
