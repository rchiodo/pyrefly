# Transitive import without annotation

`a` imports `value` from `b`, where `value = compute()` has no type
annotation. `compute()` is defined in `c` with `-> int`.

`b -> c::KeyExport("compute")` resolves the function to determine
`value`'s type. Its children show `c` resolving `int` from builtins.
`a -> b::KeyExport("value")` then gets the resolved type.

All demands are necessary — without an annotation on `value`, the
type must be inferred by resolving the call chain. No superfluous
demands.

## Files

`a.py`:
```python
from b import value
x = value + 1
```

`b.py`:
```python
from c import compute
value = compute()
```

`c.py`:
```python
def compute() -> int: return 42
```
