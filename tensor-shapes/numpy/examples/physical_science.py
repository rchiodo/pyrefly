    dimensionless finite-difference version samples the interior of the interval

    `N x N` tridiagonal matrix. The main diagonal has length `N`, while each
    off-diagonal has length `N - 1`; placing those off-diagonal vectors at
    offsets `+1` and `-1` still produces `N x N` matrices. Solving the symmetric
