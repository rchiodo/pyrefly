    pointing from each target particle toward each source particle. The norm
    keeps a singleton final axis so the `(N, N, 1)` distance scale broadcasts
    back over the 3-D vector components. In units where the gravitational
    constant is `G = 1`, multiplying by target and source masses gives pairwise
